### Edit

- Changed mcp.py to mcp_handler.py to prevent potential import confusion between 'mcp' package and 'mcp.py'. Edited dockerfile to 'latest' so it doesnt spin up old builds after image creation. Also edited preinstall to ensure the mcp related dependencies can load non-interactive.
- Initialize will now attempt to ensure all mcps are globally installed when the system starts.
- Cleaned up the unneeded mcp config in agent.py
- Cleaned up MCP logs and check attempts.
- Removed unneeded dependencies to slim images for dockerfile install and cuda.
- Get_terminal_output function in code_execution_tool.py is now enhanced to detect common shell prompt patterns (like (venv) ...$, root@...:~#, etc.) using regex. When such a prompt is detected in the output, the function will immediately break and return the output, rather than waiting for the full timeout.
- Code Exe Md to discourage multi-line f.write() calls. (prevent UI errors during code execution tool)
- Prevent the FAISS/KeyError (or any extension error) from crashing agent loop at the agent.py level. The call to self.call_extensions("message_loop_prompts", ...) in prepare_prompt is now wrapped in a try/except block.
- Revised problem solving/bug fixing guidance to discourage common indentation-error prone methods.
- Code Exe Md prompt to further discourse line by line edits, multiple seperate f.write calls, complex string manipulation. encouraged reading, implement fix, and check syntax. context a little bulky but working for now.
- Team Agent System Prompts
- Loop detection now trunacates the looped info so we flood the LLM with less repeated context.
- Encourage cat > EOF multiline edits for code and documentation
- Changed mcp.py to mcp_handler.py to prevent potential import confusion between 'mcp' package and 'mcp.py'. Edited dockerfile to 'latest' so it doesnt spin up old builds after image creation. Also edited preinstall to ensure the mcp related dependencies can load non-interactive.
- Initialize will now attempt to ensure all mcps are globally installed when the system starts.
- Slimmed context of code exe md prompt
- Cleaned up the unneeded mcp config in agent.py
- Cleaned up MCP logs and check attempts.
- Removed unneeded dependencies to slim images for dockerfile install and cuda.
